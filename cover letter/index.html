    <p class="lead">Dear Manager: </p>
    <p><span itemprop="name">Hi, my name is RUEILI JHANG,</span> As a fourth-year IT student, my career goal is to become a front-end and back-end developer with comprehensive innovation in technology and thinking. 
      The reason why I chose to become a front-end and back-end developer is because I feel that this role can make a difference. 
      I can create different styles of web interfaces for customers and build a powerful server backend. In this role,
      I can use my familiar programming languages ​​and my passion for web design and back-end architecture to build dynamic and static websites. and applications.
      <span itemprop="title">In the process of learning, I not only learned programming languages ​​​​and technologies, I also learned how to solve problems. 
      I even kept cracking them without realizing that I stayed up all night. I also understood how to communicate with members in a team. 
      We allocate tasks and overcome challenges together. The experience may be a bit hard, but I have gained a lot in the process of growing up. </span>
      <span itemprop="title">Recently I am learning AWS cloud services. After learning about CloudFormation automation,  I used this tool to learn how to quickly set up a secure VPC and manage virtual server settings in EC2 instances. 
      I also learned to use S3 to store website resources and successfully achieved compatibility. These processes allowed me to understand the modern architecture of AWS. It not only taught me how to effectively utilize cloud resources, 
      but also taught me a solid architecture from back-end to front-end website. I feel this is an indispensable tool for modern website development. 
      And I also think my understanding of automation and practices will be of great help in the role I choose. It can improve the efficiency of the team and also create value for the company.
